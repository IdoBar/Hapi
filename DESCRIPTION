Description: Hapi (short for Haplotyping with imperfect genotype data) is a novel easy-to-use, 
	R package for inference of chromosome-length haplotypes using a few haploid 
	gametes of an individual. The gamete genotype data may be generated from various platforms 
	including genotyping arrays and sequencing even with low-coverage. Hapi simply takes 
	genotype data of known hetSNPs in single gamete cells as input and report the high-resolution 
	haplotypes as well as confidence of each phased hetSNPs. The package also includes a module 
	allowing downstream analyses and visualization of identified crossovers in the gametes.
